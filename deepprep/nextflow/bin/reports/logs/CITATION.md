# Contributing to *DeepPrep*

Welcome to the *DeepPrep* repository!
We're excited you're here and want to contribute.

**Imposter's syndrome disclaimer**[^1]: We want your help. No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that
you're not ready to be an open-source contributor; that your skills
aren't nearly good enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a
project like this one?
